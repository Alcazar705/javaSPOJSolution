PRIME1 - Prime Generator

Peter wants to generate some prime numbers for his cryptosystem. 
Help him! Your task is to generate all prime numbers between two given numbers!

Input
The input begins with the number t of test cases in a single line (t<=10). 
In each of the next t lines there are two numbers m and n (1 <= m <= n <= 1000000000, n-m<=100000) separated by a space.

Output
For every test case print all prime numbers p such that m <= p <= n, one number per line, test cases separated by an empty line.

Example
Input:
2
1 10
3 5

Output:
2
3
5
7

3
5

Solution:
As we can see the values of input are hugh and it will take a really long time to execute it.
So, a better method isto find the prime number in between 2 and the squareroot of that number.
In this wawy you will never get have to use any data structures and you will never get Time limit exceded

Code:
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Main
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception{
		
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int t=sc.nextInt();
        while(t-->0)
        {
            int a=sc.nextInt();
            int b=sc.nextInt();

            for(int i=a;i<=b;i++)
            {
                if(i==1)
                    continue;
                int count=0;
                int lim=(int)Math.sqrt(i);
                for(int j=2;j<=lim;j++)
                {
                    if(i%j == 0)
                    {
                        count++;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if(count == 0)
                    System.out.print(i + " ");

            }
            System.out.println();}
	}
		
	
}
