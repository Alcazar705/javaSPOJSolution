TEST - Life, the Universe, and Everything

Your program is to use the brute-force approach in order to find the Answer to 
Life, the Universe, and Everything. 
More precisely... rewrite small numbers from input to output. 
Stop processing input after reading in the number 42. 
All numbers at input are integers of one or two digits.


Example
Input:
1
2
88
42
99

Output:
1
2
88


Solution:
In this question we are asked to take input from the user until he entered 42.
As soon as he entered 42 the program should stop working.

Code:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = 0;
        while(true){
            x = sc.nextInt();
            if(x == 42) break;
            else System.out.println(x);
        }
    }
}
